TREND-DB introduces a couple of terms which could be new to you.
To avoid any confusion, we provide a definition for each of them in the elencation below.

</br></br>

- **3'end**: refers to the 3' end of the messenger RNA molecule
- **Alternative splicing**: can be considered as a ubiquitous mechanism for the generation of multiple protein isoforms, all originating from single genes. It is often regarded among the main factors contributing to isoform diversity.
- **APA**: Alternative PolyAdenylation, one of the actors in the landscape of mechanisms that diversificate the transcriptome in metazoan organisms.
- **FC**: Fold Change, commonly employed as a measure of change for a continuous variable (e.g. in RNA-seq for expression values between experimental groups). In this context, this amount refers to the ratio of (normalized) reads assigned to the 3' ends of the isoforms to quantify the extent of regulation.
- **GO**: Gene Ontology, a database resource (http://geneontology.org) that provides structured knowledge regarding the functions of genes and gene products.
- **isoform shortening/lengthening**: refers to an APA phenotype, where a given gene expresses a relatively higher fraction of shorter transcript isoform (or longer, respectively) compared to the other transcript isoforms (based on a proxy of the two most significantly affected APA isoforms) after depletion of an APA regulator (compared to the control knockdown; for detailed description see Ogorodnikov et al. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-07580-5)
- **PAS**: poly(A) site, genomic regions where a polyadenylation signal is present - of particular interest in the regulation of polyadenylation.
- **Shortening Index (SI)**: describes the overall tendency of a given gene to express shortened (or lengthened, respectively) transcript isoforms (based on a proxy of the two most significantly affected APA isoforms; for detailed description see Ogorodnikov et al. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-07580-5)
- **TREND**: Transcriptome 3'end diversification (steady state phenotype of the transcriptome 3â€™end; integrates primary (e.g. APA) and secondary effects (e.g. RNA stability etc), which determine the fate of a given transcript.
- **TRENDseq**: a novel high-throughput sequencing approach suited to capture polyadenylated transcript 3' ends of numerous experimental conditions in a highly multiplexed fashion. This is described in detail in these manuscripts: https://doi.org/10.1007/s00424-016-1828-3 and https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-07580-5.
