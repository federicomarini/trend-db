<div>Plots in this tab are created using the <strong>Gviz</strong> package. Aside from the reference track of the selected gene and its chromosome, the control track as well as the selected condition are shown. <br>
      The default condition is the condition with the maximum SI for this gene, it can however be changed using the drop-down menu.<br>
      Adjusting the <strong> Number of similarily affected</strong> slider will print genes that are affected in a similar way as the selected gene (with the amount of them determined by the slider). </div>
