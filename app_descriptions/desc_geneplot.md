Plots in this tab are created using the `Gviz` package. 
Aside from the reference track of the selected gene and its chromosome, the control track as well as the selected condition are shown. 

The default condition is the condition with the maximum SI for this gene, it can however be changed using the drop-down menu.

Adjusting the **Number of similarly affected genes** slider will print genes that are affected in a similar way as the selected gene (with the amount of them determined by the slider).
