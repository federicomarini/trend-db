<div><h4><a name='goana'></a>GO Enrichment:</h4><br> The <strong>Goana</strong> (Limma Package) method performs an over-representation analysis for Gene Ontology terms in a list of Entrez Gene IDs.
      The list of genes affected in the selected condition is used as a gene set with all genes as a background. <br>
      Columns in the resulting table show the following: <br>
      <strong>Term</strong> GO Term <br> <strong>Ont</strong> ontology that the GO term belongs to ('BP', 'CC' or 'MF')<br>
      <strong>N</strong> number of genes in the GO term <br> <strong>DE</strong> number of genes in the provided gene set<br>
      <strong>P.DE</strong> p-value for over-representation of the GO term in the set<br><br>Click the <strong>Goana</strong>
