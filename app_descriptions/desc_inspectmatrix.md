This is an overview of all shortening index values of each gene across all conditions.

Adjust the '**Filter by shortening index**' slider to only show genes with a shortening index value (absolute) above the threshold in at least one condition. 

Select a row in the table to print a summary table of the selected gene, showing the conditions in which it is affected with the respective shortening indices and p-values.
