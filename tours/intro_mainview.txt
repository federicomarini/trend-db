#Welcome;Welcome to the <b>Main View</b> tour for <code>TREND-DB</code>!
#trendnetwork;<strong>This is the APA network view.</strong> It visualizes the global effects on APA upon siRNA-mediated depletion of the proteins indicated (for the functional category each factor is assigned to, see legend to the color code - as an example, factors depicted in dark red belong to the class of 3’end processing factors).
#trendnetwork;The diameter of the nodes increases with the number of APA-affected genes. Factors in close proximity to each other share identical genes affected by APA. They have synergistic effects, when the links between nodes are depicted in green (e.g. depletion of two neighboring factors leads to a similar lengthening or shortening APA phenotype of a common pool of genes). They have antagonistic (opposing) effects when the links are depicted in red (e.g. depletion of protein A results in a reciprocal lengthening or shortening APA phenotype as compared to depletion of protein B). 
#trendnetwork;The width of the link indicates the BH-adjusted p-value (Fisher’s exact test) reflecting overrepresentation of genes being synergistically or antagonistically regulated. As an example, depletion of NUDT21 regulates APA of an identical set of genes in the same direction as depletion of CPSF6 does (synergistic function, link depicted in green). In contrast, NUDT21 has a reciprocal/antagonistic function on APA as compared to PCF11 (link depicted in red). They share a significant, albeit lower, amount of identical genes regulated as compared to the knockdown pair CPSF6 and NUDT21 (for further details see Ogorodnikov et al. Nat Commun (link: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-07580-5#Sec38), the phylogenetic conservation and functional hierarchy of selected factors can be found in the supplementary data (link to: https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-018-07580-5/MediaObjects/41467_2018_7580_MOESM2_ESM.pdf)).
#trendnetwork;To enhance visibility this network is dynamic - you can drag nodes to better see neighboring factors that affect APA of an identical set of genes. Alternatively, you can double-click on selected nodes to highlight immediate neighboring factors. You can slide over nodes and the genes names will be displayed in a popup window, you can scroll in and out to enlarge or minimize the APA network view.
#trendnetwork;In the upper left (pull-down menu “select by group”) you can also selectively highlight depleted factors per functional category and thereby explore if and how they “interact” to control APA of identical sets of genes. As an example, selecting splicing factors you will find that U2AF1 and U2AF2 regulate APA and that they share an identical set of genes affected by APA. In contrast, the splicing factor SRSF3 regulates APA of an entirely independent set of genes. Reflecting their intermolecular interactions, components of cleavage factor Im complex (NUDT21 and CPSF6), and cleavage factor IIm complex (PCF11 and CLP1) represent central hubs in directional APA regulation. Further, they act synergistically within the complex and counteract the function of respective other complex (for a comprehensive overview directly comparing APA effects see Ogorodnikov et al. Nat Commun Figure 2b: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-07580-5/figures/2).
