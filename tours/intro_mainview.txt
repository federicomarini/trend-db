#Welcome;Welcome to the <b>Main View</b> tour for <code>TREND-DB</code>!
#trendnetwork;<strong>This is the APA network view.</strong> It visualizes the global effects on APA upon siRNA-mediated depletion of the proteins indicated (for the functional category each factor is assigned to, see legend to the color code - as an example, factors depicted in dark red belong to the class of 3'end processing factors).
#trendnetwork;The radius of the nodes increases with the number of APA-affected genes. Factors in close proximity to each other share identical genes affected by APA. They have synergistic effects, when the links between nodes are depicted in green (e.g. depletion of two neighboring factors leads to a similar lengthening or shortening APA phenotype of a common pool of genes). They have antagonistic (opposing) effects when the links are depicted in red (e.g. depletion of protein A results in a reciprocal lengthening or shortening APA phenotype as compared to depletion of protein B). 
#trendnetwork;The width of the link indicates the BH-adjusted p-value (Fisher's exact test), reflecting overrepresentation of genes being synergistically or antagonistically regulated. As an example, depletion of NUDT21 regulates APA of an identical set of genes in the same direction as depletion of CPSF6 does (synergistic function, link depicted in green). In contrast, NUDT21 has a reciprocal/antagonistic function on APA as compared to PCF11 (link depicted in red). They share a significant, albeit lower, amount of identical genes regulated as compared to the knockdown pair CPSF6 and NUDT21 (for further details see <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-07580-5" target="_blank">Ogorodnikov et al., Nat Commun</a>), the phylogenetic conservation and functional hierarchy of selected factors can be found in the <a href="https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-018-07580-5/MediaObjects/41467_2018_7580_MOESM2_ESM.pdf" target="_blank">supplementary data</a>. 
#trendnetwork;To enhance visibility this network is interactive - you can drag nodes to better see neighboring factors that affect APA of an identical set of genes. Alternatively, you can click on selected nodes to highlight immediate neighboring factors. You can hover over nodes and the genes names will be displayed in a tooltip window, you can scroll in and out to enlarge or minimize the APA network view.
#trendnetwork;In the upper left (pull-down menu "select by group") you can also selectively highlight depleted factors per functional category and thereby explore if and how they "interact"" to control APA of identical sets of genes. As an example, selecting splicing factors you will find that U2AF1 and U2AF2 regulate APA and that they share an identical set of genes affected by APA. In contrast, the splicing factor SRSF3 regulates APA of an entirely independent set of genes. Reflecting their intermolecular interactions, components of cleavage factor Im complex (NUDT21 and CPSF6), and cleavage factor IIm complex (PCF11 and CLP1) represent central hubs in directional APA regulation. Further, they act synergistically within the complex and counteract the function of respective other complex (for a comprehensive overview directly comparing APA effects, see <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-07580-5/figures/2" target="_blank">Ogorodnikov et al. Nat Commun Figure 2b</a>.<br><br>Notably, the selected element in the APA network will affect the displayed content in the rest of the user interface. You will learn how to do so in the following steps, together with interacting directly with the other widgets.
#geneInput + .selectize-control;This is the gene view. <br><br>If you want to see if a specific gene is affected by (significant) APA regulation in any of the currently available >170 knockdown conditions, select the gene in the pull-down menu or type in the gene name. If a gene name is not shown, APA in this gene is either non-significant or respective transcripts were below the detection limit.
#kdInput + .selectize-control;This is the condition view. <br><br>If you want to see which genes are affected by (significant) APA regulation in specific knockdown conditions, select the knockdown condition in the pull-down menu or type in the knockdown-condition.
#geneInput + .selectize-control;Try selecting for example the gene <b>OAZ1</b>. You can also leverage the autocompletion feature for easily selecting the feature you're interested into.
#geneInfoMain;Upon selection of your gene of interest in the Gene View, you also receive additional information on that in this box, either about its chromosomal location, in the hg38 human annotation...
#geneSummary;... or with details provided via the Entrez database.
#NCBImain;A link can take you there directly by opening another tab, so that you can continue further.
#geneTableOutput;This table displays all the knockdown conditions in which your gene of interest is significantly affected by APA. A <em>positive shortening index</em> (>0) indicates that APA is shifted towards a proximal poly(A) site upon depletion of the respective factor (i.e. your gene of interest expresses relatively more shorter transcript isoforms as compared to the control knockdown - "APA shortening phenotype"). Vice versa, a <em>negative shortening index </em> indicates that APA of your gene of interest is predominantly shifted towards a distal poly(A) site ("APA lengthening phenotype").
#geneTableOutput; The p-values "short" and "long" display the relative change of polyadenylation at the two most strongly affected poly(A) sites. For further information on annotation of poly(A) sites and calculation of relative poly(A) site usage, see <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-07580-5" target="_blank">Ogorodnikov et al., Nat Commun</a>. If the hitlist of conditions (i.e. knockdowns) affecting your gene of interest is very long, you can use the search function, and/or change the sorting according to the respective column (e.g. p-value in  ascending order, ...).
#continueGP;If you are interested in plotting the data focused on this particular gene, you can click on this button to jump to the dedicated Gene Plot tab (this could terminate the tour, though). In the new tab, you can display the genomic coverage signal for the 3'TRENDseq reads (APA) will be displayed for your gene of interest.
#kdInput + .selectize-control;You can also use this dropdown menu to select the knockdown condition you want to focus on. For example, try to select <b>BARD1_kd</b>.
#trendnetwork;As already mentioned, it is possible to select the node also directly from the interactive network. Select another node now from the network (e.g. <b>PCF11_kd</b>, by clicking on the "Select by id" dropdown)...
#kdInput + .selectize-control;... you can notice that once a node is selected, this information is passed to the other widgets.
#kdTableOutput;In the table "Affected genes", you'll find all genes that show an APA-phenotype upon depletion of your factor of interest.
#geneinfo_condition;The box below the selected knockdown condition will automatically generate a number of links to external databases for further exploration. These include the NCBI Gene database, the GTEx Portal, the Uniprot Portal, the dbPTM Portal (for Post-Translational Modifications), or the Human Protein Atlas. All links will open in new tabs.
#showScatterplot;Pressing the "Scatterplot" button will result in a popup modal containing a graph displaying the number of APA-events per condition (i.e. knockdown). Red and blue dots denote genes in which polyadenylation more frequently occurs at distal and proximal poly(A) sites, respectively (as compared to the control knockdown).
#goToGoana;Based on the list of genes affected by APA after depletion of your factor of interest, you can perform Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis - move to the next section by clicking on this button.
#goana_desc;You'll receive some information about the method used (the <code>goana</code> function from the limma package), and the format of the table that will be returned.
#goanaSubmit; Please click on this button to start the GO enrichment analysis - this is required to generate the content for the next steps. This operation might take a few seconds.
#goanaTable;Once the results table has been generated, you can explore its content in this interactive DataTable, which is also searchable in all fields (if you for example want to check a particular Gene Ontology term). You can also click directly on each of the buttons associated to the GO term to open an external page, linking to its correspondent entry in the AmiGO database.
#Thanks;Thank you for taking the tour for the <b>Main View</b> tab of <code>TREND-DB</code>!
