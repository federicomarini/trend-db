# `tours` folder

This folder contains the scripted tours, intended to guide the users through the functionality of the user interface.
They can also be used to "tell a story", by highlighting consecutive aspects which normally require some degree of interaction with the app.

The tours are based on the implementation provided by the `rintrojs` package.
